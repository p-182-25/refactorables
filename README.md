SoloLearn - refactorable numbers challenge
https://www.sololearn.com/Discuss/722310/challenge-refactorable-number

A "refactorable number" is a number n that is divisible by the count of it's divisors.
For example, 18 is a refactorable number, because it's divisors are:
1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 18 (6 divisors) and 18/6 is an integer.

task: write a code that outputs all refactorable numbers from 1 to x (user input) in any language you want!
